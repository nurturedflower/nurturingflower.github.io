                        in my state.
                        <br><br>
                        It was originally up
                        on my itch.io page,
                        but took it down after
                        a while, but I plan
                        to redo the book at
                        some point.
                        <br><br>
                        The book was originally
                        about Hoshi and Erika,
                        two of my OCs from my
                        Nurture OC Project,
                        bumping into each other
                        one day, but getting to
                        know each other, and
                        eventually falling in
                        love with each other
                        over the time they
                        spend together.

                        It was originally a

                        OC Project, going through
                        the process of transitioning
                        as a transgender person (FTM),
                        who also happens to get wizard

                        The redux will feature
                        elements of LGBTQ+ topics,
                        especially since the characters
                        in the redux are LGBTQ+.

                        This project was a
                        project I originally
                        started the day of
                        Porter Robinson's
                        second album, Nurture,
                        was released.
                        <br><br>
                        Originally a fan
                        project dedicated to
                        my love and support
                        for the album, I plan
                        to bring these OCs
                        back, but with
                        updated designs,
                        updated backstories,
                        and anupdated plot of
                        the project.
                        <br><br>
                        The project redux will
                        also include a lot of
                        concepts for each character,
                        the world in the universe
                        they live in, updated lore,
                        etc.
                        <br><br>
                        I've also abandoned this
                        project due to stuff being
                        in the way, but it'll be
                        coming back soon.
